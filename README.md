Notes:

Difficulties in figuring out how to rotate triangles in order to draw picture. Used ChatGPT to help problem solve this. Also used ChatGPT to help with some formatting.
Had GitHub Co-Pilot turned on while coding to autofill drawing repetetive shapes for picture.

Discussed code and some functionalities such as rotating triangles with Teddy Danielson. Watched videos and followed along with James E. Davis.

AWESOMENESS POINTS: rainbow background when clicked, formatted webpage to be a little more aethsetically pleasing.
